    <h1>Rhythm Games</h1>
    <p>Since I was a baby, my older sister played a lot of video games on her PlayStation 2, SNES, and the various versions of the GameBoy. Two games stood out the most to my little eyes, which were the Dance Dance Revolution series and Taiko Drum Master (now known as Taiko no Tatsujin), and that was when my love for rhythm games started. Many years later, I discovered Round1 in Philadelphia where I would become a regular there and a member of a local rhythm game group, FDPF (Fashion District Philly Friends).
        The rhythm games that I currently main are Project Diva Arcade Future Tone, Dance Dance Revolution, Pump It Up, and Sound Voltex. I sometimes play Gitadora, Chunithm, Maimai Finale, Music Diver, and Beatmania IIDX. </p>
