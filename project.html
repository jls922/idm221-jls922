    <h2>Virtual Pet (CS164)</h2>
    <p>In my Introduction to Computer Science course, our task for the final project was to create a virtual pet machine using what we had learned about programming and state machines. I chose to do a silly pet rock that has feelings despite its inhuman look.</p>

    <h2>Video Game (CI102/103)</h2>
    <p>In my Computing and Informatics II and III classes, we formed teams with people who expressed similar interests in creating a certain type of project like a website, mobile app, video games, and more. My team and I brainstormed, designed, programmed, tested, and released a rogue-like video game inspired by rogue-like games like The Binding of Issac and Hades.</p>
