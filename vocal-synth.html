    <h1>Vocal Synthesizer</h1>
    <p>I have always been a Vocaloid fan since I was little when I discovered songs featuring Hatsune Miku in a song pack for Stepmania, a Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) simulator that I found while watching DDR videos on YouTube. Ever since then, I have always remembered those songs and Hatsune Miku. In 7th grade, I became a huge Vocaloid fan when I rediscovered songs featuring other Vocaloid voicebanks on YouTube. As I continued to enjoy the various Vocaloid songs and covers I encountered online, COVID hit midway into my freshman year of high school in March 2020. Out of boredom and not wanting to spend money, I decided to try out UTAU, a free and customizable vocal synthesizer engine that was known for the old choppy robotic voicebanks that was created during the first few years of release along with the option to make your own voicebanks. Soon I gave Vocaloid and SynthesizerV, which both are paid commercial engines, a try, and my love for singing vocal synthesizers continued. I created a channel with my high school friend where we posted covers using the Vocaloid engine until we parted ways and I created my own channel where I continued to post covers on the three engines mentioned.</p>
